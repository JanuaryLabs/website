We're excited to announce Vercel Functions Extension, a deployment extension that integrates with Vercel serverless platform.

[Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) _enable running compute on-demand without needing to manage your own infrastructure, provision servers, or upgrade hardware._

## How does it work?

It uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) in which the action is triggered by a push event to the repository.

## How I can use it?

- Install the extension from within January.
- Follow the setup instructions in the documentation.
- Push your code from the Github panel in January.

## Get Involved

You can try it out today in the [playground](https://app.january.sh/). Weâ€™re always happy to hear your feedback.

Looking to the future, January team is running a survey to gather info from the ecosystem to help shape the API development sphere. If you have a minute, please [fill out the survey](https://tally.so/r/31KZAg).
