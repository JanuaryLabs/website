## Extensions

An extension provide additional functionalities such as database operations, sending emails, upload files and interacting with external services.

Extensions are designed to be easy to install, use, and remove. Offering a wide range of functionality for workflows, actions and policies. Some extensions requires setting up environment variables and build variables like deployment and auth extensions.

Extensions also can be dependable on other extensions, for example, the `typeorm` extension is required to use the `database` extension.
