This is an exciting week, with a lot of stuff to help developers feel at home with the platform. Today, weâ€™re introducing the **Error Lens**, which tells you about any problem right away.

The error lens brings many things to the table, including catching semantic errors and shortening the feedback loop. Additionally, you don't have to remember the options or the structure of the object you're working with for a given primitive because the Error lens will tell you what's missing or wrong.

The feature is built to model ESLint rules to make it possible for extension owners to write rules for their primitives in the future.

## What's next?

- [ ] Option to auto-fix an error if possible.
